For this assignment, you need to submit executable files (e.g. 'alg1.py' Python files), that can be run from commandline, your submission must be able to run with the following line:

"alg_name.py filename1 filename2"

where filename1 is the input list of starting boards, filename2 is the list of ground truth solutions.

You can download the sample files from this repository.

Note: You will not have access to the sudoku files that we evaluate on during grading, TA will download your executable files and run the above command line inputs (with TA's local starting boards file and corresponding groundtruth solutions file). The program should print out "Correct!" or "Wrong" for each sudoku puzzle. Check the A4fileIO notebook will help you.
